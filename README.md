## 🧠 Project Description
This project, **Credit Card Transaction Anomaly Detector**, is a hybrid AI-powered system designed to detect suspicious or fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.

It combines:
- **Rule-based logic** (simple financial thresholds and risk conditions)
- **Machine learning (Isolation Forest)** for anomaly detection
- **PlotSenseAI integration** for intelligent visualization and automated insights

Users can input key transaction details such as **Amount** and **Transaction Speed**, and the system evaluates the risk level — determining whether the transaction is *legit* or *suspicious* .  

This project was developed as part of the **PlotSense AI Hackathon**, showcasing both **ML (EDA-focused)** and **Dev (extension module)** contributions.
